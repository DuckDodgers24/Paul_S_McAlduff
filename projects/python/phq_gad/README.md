# Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screening Tools

## (PHQ-9 and GAD-7)

### About This Project

This project is a Python implementation of two widely-used mental health screening instruments:

- **PHQ-9** (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Screens for depression symptoms
- **GAD-7** (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7): Screens for anxiety symptoms

Both are public domain screening tools developed by Drs. Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, and LÃ¶we.

### Three Programming Paradigms

This project demonstrates the same functionality implemented in three different ways:

1. **Procedural** - Sequential code with loops
2. **Function-based** - Modular functions
3. **Class-based** - Object-oriented design
