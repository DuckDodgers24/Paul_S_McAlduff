This is a programming exercise implementing the PHQ-9 and GAD-7,
public domain screening tools developed by Drs. Spitzer, Kroenke,
Williams, and LÃ¶we in Python. This demo is for educational purposes 
only and is not intended for clinical use or self-diagnosis. If 
you have mental health concerns, please consult a qualified 
healthcare professional.

I for practice I will make three versions of this program:
* [PHQ GAD Procedural-based Version](phq_gad_procedural)
* PHQ GAD Function-based Version
* PHQ GAD Class-based Version
